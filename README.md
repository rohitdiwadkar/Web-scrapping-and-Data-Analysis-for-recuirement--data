# Web-scrapping-for-recuirement-analysis

We developed this desktop based application to help any company to scrape the details from web about anything related to recruitment like data for competitors state wise. By scrapping these data we did data analysis on it and predicted some insights based on data we scrapped.

In this project we have developed a desktop based application by using node.js, HTML for GUI and for scarpper we used python and for database Mysql workbench.

Tableau is used for creating a dashboard for HR and bussiness guys to understand the insights clearly through visualisation(https://public.tableau.com/profile/rohan.das#!/vizhome/FINALPRESENTATIONMONDAYFINAL/DATASOURCES?publish=yes)
